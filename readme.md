## Splice configuration
For instructions on how to set up and start your Splice Cluster, see our Spliceengine [readme](https://github.com/splicemachine/spliceengine)
## Running petclinic locally
```
	git clone https://github.com/splicemachine/spring-petclinic.git
	cd spring-petclinic
	./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

You can then access petclinic here: http://localhost:8080/

## Database configuration

In its default configuration, Petclinic uses an in-memory database (HSQLDB) which
gets populated at startup with data. 

You could start a Splice Machine database running locally by editing application.properties:

```
database=splicemachine
spring.datasource.schema=classpath*:db/${database}/schema.sql
spring.datasource.data=classpath*:db/${database}/data.sql


spring.datasource.url=jdbc:splice://localhost:1527/splicedb;user=splice;password=admin
spring.datasource.username=splice
spring.datasource.password=admin
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.splicemachine.db.jdbc.ClientDriver
spring.jpa.database-platform=com.splicemachine.SpliceMachineDialect
```
See our [tutorials](https://www.splicemachine.com/tutorial/connecting-programmatically/) to connect to our ODBC driver to allow Splice Machine to connect any other database or business tools that needs access to your database
